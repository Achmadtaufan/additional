Cause . . . . . :   Error type 6 has occurred. Error types and their meanings are: 1 -- Arithmetic overflow. 2 -- Floating point overflow. 3 -- Floating point underflow. 4 -- Floating point conversion error. 5 -- Not an exact result. 6 -- Numeric data that is not valid. 7 -- Double-byte character set (DBCS) or UTF-8 data that is not valid. 8 -- Division by zero. 9 -- Hash value cannot be computed for the requested query. 10 -- User-defined function returned a mapping error. 11 -- Not valid length found in a varying-length column returned from an array result set. 12 -- Result of a concatenation operation on a varying-length field exceeded the maximum allowed length of the result type. If the error occurred when assigning a value to a host variable of a FETCH, embedded SELECT, SET, or VALUES INTO statement, the host variable name is *N and the relative position of the host variable in the INTO clause is 0. If the host variable name is *N, the error occurred when attempting to resolve a search condition. If more than one data mapping error occurred, this is a description of the first error that occurred.  For a description of any other data mapping errors, see the previously listed messages in the job log. Recovery  . . . :   The error was caused by data that was not valid or that was too large.  Look at the previously listed messages in the job log (DSPJOBLOG command) or press F10 (Display messages in job log) on this display to determine what row and columns were involved in the error.
